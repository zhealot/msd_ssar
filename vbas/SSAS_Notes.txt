After deployment (copy rda.dotm/ar manager.dotm/ssar.dotm to Word startup folder), 
in Word VBE's Tools->Reference, set rda.dotm and ssar.domt refer to 'ar manager.dotm', BUT not the way around.
Set the folder that contains dotms as trusted loaction.

### Thoughts for VSTO
Exception handler: 
    On Error GoTo Do_Error
        bookmarkError = True
        Set target = g_assessmentReport.bookmarks(bookmarkName).Range
	...
	...
	...
	Do_Error:
		If bookmarkError Then
			....
		End If
		LogError
